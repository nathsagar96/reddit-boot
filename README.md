## **Installation** üíª

### Prerequisites

- **Java 21** installed on your machine.
- **Maven** installed for building and running the project.
- **Docker** for running Mail Server and PostgreSQL.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nathsagar96/reddit-boot-backend.git
    cd reddit-boot-backend
    ```

2. **Set Up PostgreSQL**:
    - Create a new PostgreSQL database named `reddit`.
    - Configure your database connection settings in `application.properties` or `application.yml`:

    ```properties
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/reddit_clone
    spring.datasource.username=your-username
    spring.datasource.password=your-password
    ```

3. **Build the Project**:

    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

4. **Run the Application**:

      ```bash
      mvn spring-boot:run
      ```

5. **Access Swagger UI**:
    - Once the application is running,
      visit [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html) to explore the API
      documentation.

## **Usage** üßë‚Äçüíª

### User Registration & Login

- Register a new user:

    ```bash
    POST /api/auth/register
    {
      "username": "johndoe",
      "email": "johndoe@example.com",
      "password": "password123"
    }
    ```

- Login to get a JWT token:

    ```bash
    POST /api/auth/login
    {
      "username": "johndoe",
      "password": "password123"
    }
    ```

  Use the returned JWT token to authenticate other API requests by adding it to the `Authorization` header:
  `Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>`.

### Create a Subreddit

- Create a new subreddit:

    ```bash
    POST /api/subreddits
    {
      "name": "technology",
      "description": "A subreddit for all things tech!"
    }
    ```

### Create a Post

- Create a new post in a subreddit:

    ```bash
    POST /api/posts
    {
      "title": "My First Post",
      "content": "This is my first post on Reddit Boot!",
      "subredditId": 1
    }
    ```

### Upvote a Post

- Upvote a post:

    ```bash
    POST /api/posts/1/vote?username=janedoe&voteType=UPVOTE
